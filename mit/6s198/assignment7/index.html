		<p>This application, which I called <b>Conversions</b>, is used to convert from pounds, inches, and farenheit units (aka <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/RwI0oeZQAYDy8/giphy.gif" target="_blank">American units)</a> to kilograms, centimeters, and celcius units, respectively. I used the ExplicitIntents application that I built during class as a template to create a multiple-screen app, using intents to pass along the contents of the editable text boxes of the main screen to the second screen, where I calculate the appropriate conversions. In addition, I implemented other tiny features that were discussed and taught during the past couple lectures, including adding a sound on a click event, making a button image-based, and using a table layout to organize components. Also, I made a custom app icon that looks <i>quite</i> nice, if I might add.</p>
