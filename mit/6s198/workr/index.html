		<p><b>Project Update 4/21/15:</b> We've checked in with Dave Mitchell through email and he's provided substantial and useful feedback for our application; we plan on meeting up with him in person on 4/22/15. The project features that have already been implemented are getting user permissions to use their calendar and extract events, parsing these events along with the user-defined tasks to specify "free time" available (which will be used in our notification algorithm), and small steps in creating the notification/services system. The UI has a basic implementation of adding and deleting assignments.</p>
