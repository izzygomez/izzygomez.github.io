		<h1>Assignment 8</h1>
		<h2>Part 1</h2>
		<h3>Sleepy</h3>

		<p>In the Sleepy application, I created a simple user interface with three buttons which start a timer of 20, 60, or 90 minutes, respectively. The timers are created by the use of the implicit intent described by the <i>ACTION_SET_TIMER</i> action (<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-common.html">as explained here</a>). These values represent the duration of naps to take throughout the day, in accordance with what research suggest are optimal nap time durations; the inspiration/source for the application is linked from the app (<a href="http://lifehacker.com/how-long-to-nap-for-the-biggest-brain-benefits-1251546669">and here!</a>).</p>

		<h3>GetBackToMe</h3>
