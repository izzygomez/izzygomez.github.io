# Redirects

Directory to contain redirects to miscellaneous resources, both external (e.g. google spreadsheet link) or internal. Set `permalink` in the Jekyll front matter to customize URL.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If a permalink is renamed or updated in any way such that the old URL no longer works, prefer to keep the old URL working by having it redirect to the new URL & making the new URL a new folder in this directory. See `juggernaut/` & `jggrnt/` for an example.
