		<p><b>"Suffer the pain of discipline, or suffer the pain of regret"</b> -<i>Jim Rohn</i></p>
		<p>TODO write more concrete goals</p>
		<p><i>thoughts:</i> maybe make concrete goals or steps that are direct descendants of the goals listed below, e.g. "sleep well" --> "get 8 hours of sleep every night by setting a routine sleep schedule through technological tools, time management, and discipline."</p>
		<p><b>META GOAL:<i><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_keep_your_goals_to_yourself?language=en">Keep my goals private</a></i></b></p>
		<p>For my own sake, hereâ€™s a couple of things I think are important to continuously be working to improve or maintain. Call them goals or healthy reminders:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Maintain good health
				<ul>
					<li>maintain a workout schedule
					<li>meditate frequently</li>
					<li>eat well</li>
					<li>sleep well</li>
					<li>supplement well</li>
					<li>minimize risky habits</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Understand how happiness is achieved through self-improvement
				<ul>
					<li>remind myself why I do activities</li>
					<li>never stop learning</li>
					<li>never stop improving</li>
					<li>give something back</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Be Social
				<ul>
					<li>understand human psychology and body language</li>
					<li>strive to be passionate and peaceful</li>
					<li>ignore naysayers</li>
					<li>make friends</li>
					<li>become the person you would want to associate yourself with</li>
					<li>keep in touch</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>
