TODO write this out from following notes

- was using Goodreads, but its UX is terrible, wanted to own my data
- writing a review has many benefits
  - helps me be a more engaged reader
  - helps me synthesizes my thoughts
  - good practice writing (writing first drafts myself, only using LLM later for slight edits)
  - will be a useful signal for future me on whether a book is worth revisiting
  - might be useful for others
- wanted a reason to start posting content on my site again
- mention that I was inspired by [Patrick Collison's bookshelf](https://patrickcollison.com/bookshelf)
- march 5th, 2025: read [this substack post](https://www.slowboring.com/p/a-very-online-persons-attempt-to) by Matty Yglesias that I feel captures my thoughts on reading well. incidentally, Yglesias also links to [a Collison tweet](https://x.com/patrickc/status/1872592892373487765) summarizing thoughts about books he read last year
