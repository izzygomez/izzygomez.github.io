# Books (/books)

This dir will contain all book related content, except for the actual book reviews themselves. Those are stored in `collections/_books/`. The reason for this is that book reviews will be grouped in a [collection](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/) for easier accessing, but that requires them to exist inside `collections/`.

To create a new book from project root, run `cp books/template.md collections/_books/{current-year}/new-book.md` & address TODOs in the new file.
