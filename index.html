<h2>Hey, I'm Izzy Gomez 👋🏼</h2>

<p>
  Previously, I worked at Google & at a fintech/web3 startup, after studying
  computer science at MIT. Here's my

    {{ site.baseurl }}/resume
  {% endcapture %}
  {% include external.html url=resume_url text="resume" punctuation="." %}

  These days I'm running a lot, trying to read more, & coding on some side
  projects. If you'd like to connect on any of these fronts, my email & socials
  are below — don't be shy, say hi ✌🏼
