<h1>Yo, I'm Izzy.</h1>

<p>I'm a computer science graduate from MIT. For the past few years I've been living in San Francisco & working at Google on YouTube Music as a software engineer 👨🏻‍💻. Here's my <a href="https://izzygomez.com/resume">resume</a> for those interested.</p>

<p>Beyond those recruiter-friendly facts, here are a few other things I enjoy doing 😄</p>

<ul>
  <div id="soccer">
    <li onclick="expandAndRemoveFade('soccer')">
      <span class="li-content item-fade items-links-not-clickable">
        ⚽ Soccer! I've been playing for over 20 years now & am a part of a few leagues around SF when there isn't a global pandemic going on. Not a fan of any one club, so I enjoy watching games as long as there are good tekkers.

        🎶 All things music! I'm an amateur pianist. Some of my fondest memories were made at live music events with close friends. I can probably sing along to every word <a href="https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCETYiBLjt2v-pcKSgf8pe6g" target="_blank">Frank Ocean</a> has penned. I'm always exploring artists' discographies; recently, I've been enjoying <a href="https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCeYz6rzUGhVwqxRM37FUo8w" target="_blank">Rosalía</a> & <a href="https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCWmnkYUzoOiOztmPBhIlZjg" target="_blank">Aphex Twin</a>. Check out my small but growing <a href="https://www.discogs.com/user/izzygomez/collection?page=1&sort=artist%2Casc&folder=0&limit=250" target="_blank">vinyl collection</a>!

  <div id="learn">
    <li onclick="expandAndRemoveFade('learn')">
      <span class="li-content item-fade items-links-not-clickable">
        📚 Learning about new things! My most recent reads include <a href="https://www.amazon.com/You-Want-Talk-About-Race/dp/1580058825" target="_blank"><i>So You Want to Talk About Race</i></a> & <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Waking-Up-Spirituality-Without-Religion/dp/1451636024/" target="_blank"><i>Waking Up</i></a> — highly recommend both. I'm always down for a sobering (or not-so-sober) conversation about the latest in cosmology & space exploration. What's something you recently learned that you believe is worth knowing about?

        ⛰️ Going outdoors! Whether it's <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/26143026" target="_blank">running</a> around the city or discovering dope hiking spots around the Bay Area, I'm a huge proponent of getting outside & breathing some fresh air. I recently had first-time experiences <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jMaCcV8MC8&list=PLHzR3hXWj9t93u_Fvunp1bHq-5BTkhPAs&index=39&t=0s" target="_blank">backpacking</a> & <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1vVfbRp-04&list=PLHzR3hXWj9t93u_Fvunp1bHq-5BTkhPAs&index=41&t=4s" target="_blank">crayfishing</a> (friend edited these using content we both captured) — stay tuned for more!
