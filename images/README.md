# Images

- `blog/` contains pictures used in blog posts.
- `me/` contains picture of _moi_
- `redirects/` are pictures used in redirect pages.
  > **Note:** This used to contain images that were used for setting custom icons for redirects that I would save as shortcuts on an iOS home screen (see [this code](https://github.com/izzygomez/izzygomez.github.io/blob/23e3351a100442b8c21e013e7ce84a63588d4714/_layouts/sheet_redirect.html#L25-L27)), but this support has been removed since I can now accomplish home screen shortcuts via the native Shortcuts app. Will keep existing images for posterity.
