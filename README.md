# izzygomez.github.io
Personal website

## TODOs
* use materialize.css to make a contact form (or just make a contact form in general)
* make site-wide font be Roboto (check Google Fonts)
* FB, LI, GH, Email, and Resume links in front page --> make them buttons like in old front page
	- make them appear after the typed intro
* add option to skip typed intro
* look into implementing a nicer-looking UI to the site
	- changing the background to something other than the plain grey?
* add nice picture tiles display of the projects and experiments listed in labs/, and look into either making the corresponding descriptions collapsible or present in a different view than the one when you first open labs/index.html

## Done
* use [typed.js](https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js/)
