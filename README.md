# Izzy's Personal Website

Always a work in progress™️

TODOs
* Update `resume/` with more up-to-date info
  * consider changing style to `\moderncvstyle{classic}` in latex file.
  * consider having a `projects/` page that has resume contents in page form
* Cleanup subdir's here & either delete them or link to them in some capacity in main landing page.
* Include pics (of me?) / maybe feed from socials?
* Create `bookshelf/` (a la https://patrickcollison.com/bookshelf).
* Add some explanation of directory layout here in README.

Notes
* Ideally would like to update `master` branch name to `main`, but `git.io/izzy` redirects specifically to `master` & [can't be edited anymore](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-04-25-git-io-deprecation/), & I like aesthetic links in footer.
