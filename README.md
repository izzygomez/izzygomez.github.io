# Izzy's Personal Website ‚ú®

Always a work in progress‚Ñ¢Ô∏è

## Development

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/izzygomez/izzygomez.github.io`
1. Initialize & download submodules: `git submodule update --init --recursive`

## TODOs
* Update `resume/` with more up-to-date info
  * consider changing style to `\moderncvstyle{classic}` in latex file.
  * consider having a `projects/` page that has resume contents in page form
* Cleanup subdir's here & either delete them or link to them in some capacity on landing page.
* Include pics (of me?) / maybe feed from socials on landing page? (note: `images/me/` exists now)
* Create `bookshelf/` (a la https://patrickcollison.com/bookshelf).
* Add some explanation of directory layout here in `README`.
* Add a section to this README (or possibly blog post?) detailing how this website & email server is setup (mailgun, namecheap, github pages, cloudflare, etc).

## Notes
* Ideally would update `master` branch name to `main` ([context](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-10-01-the-default-branch-for-newly-created-repositories-is-now-main/)) but [git.io/izzy](https://git.io/izzy) redirects to `master` & [can't be edited anymore](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-04-25-git-io-deprecation/) ‚Äî & I like that succinct, aesthetic link in the website footer ü´†.
