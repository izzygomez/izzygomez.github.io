# Sources of Motivation
- [Blogging like a Hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html) by Tom Preston-Werner
	- wanted full control over my content
	- CMS (Wordpress) felt spoon-fed, liked the idea of customizing my website from the ground up
	- also didn't want to ctrl-c ctrl-v all the constant HTML throughout my site if I was going to be writing multiple HTML pages
	- in retrospect, writing raw HTML is a bit cumbersome too, so being able to write in Markdown is a huge +
	- liked the idea of being called a Hacker: cue MIT hacker culture (pranks, CSAIL, etc.), the maker community... essentially, someone that's able to *build* anything they want 
- [What is a Hacker](http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#what_is) by Eric S. Raymond
	- formal definition of what a Hacker is; make sure point is made that my interpretation of Hacker is not being a *cracker* (as defined by the Jargon File, which is linked in Raymond's site)
	- intrigued by the cross-over between many things that had been recently interested me: open-source community, hacker culture as seen in CSAIL and its history (e.g. Stallman), "Hackers and Painters" by Paul Graham
- [The Motivaton Hacker](http://www.nickwinter.net/the-motivation-hacker) by Nick Winter
	- nice little book about personal analytics, motivation "hacking" (i.e. lifehacking), exposed me to Quantified Self, beeminder
	- formalized the lifestyle of wanting to be the best version of oneself through a rational and scientific stucture: structure is set of habits, goals, etc; scientific because you collect information on tools that might work for you, and you learn this by experimenting with yourself; rational because this life-hacker lifestyle draws from current literature on habit-formation, willpower, cognitive function (think "The Power of Habit" and "Thinking Fast and Slow")
- [Alex Vermeer's Life Hacking page](http://alexvermeer.com/life-hacking/)
	- bouncing off of last sub-point, nice one-page summary of how to automate some parts of life for efficiency and possibly happiness
