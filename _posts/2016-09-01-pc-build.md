title: Back-to-school PC Build

After a long and successful summer at Amazon Lab126, I've justified both building a PC and getting a Vive. I was blown away by the VR experience offered by the Vive over the summer, after Henry (another intern) also built a rig and bought a Vive.

I'd been eager to build a PC for the learning experience for a couple years now, so deciding to jump on the VR bandwagon was the perfect excuse.

In all seriousness, building the PC and crash-coursing all the information needed to do so (shoutout to [PC Part Picker](https://pcpartpicker.com/), [r/buildapc](https://reddit.com/r/buildapc), and mostly both Henry and Richard for helping me get to the final parts list) has been a great learning experience. And, as a CS student, I'm sure to find some use for the extra processing power and RAM I now have. Current plans include working with and training neural nets for personal projects, and getting into VR development. More on that as these plans develop into something more concrete.

So far, it's worked amazingly well. Installing Windows 10 was a breeze. It looks beautiful. The case *could* use some LED strips for vanity's sake (but what case *doesn't*?). And showing off the Vive to friends has been a ton of fun. VR is the future, mark my words.
