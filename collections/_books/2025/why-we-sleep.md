> “The number of people who can survive on five hours of sleep or less without impairment, and rounded to a whole number, is zero.” _- Dr Thomas Roth, Henry Ford Hospital (Chapter 7, page 145)_

Fantastic book that has come at a perfect time to solidify my sleep hygiene habits that I've been experimenting with over the past year. More on this later (_My Takeaways_).

This book is comprehensive, well-paced, & never dull. It discusses: the biological basis for sleep, its form & function, how sleep has evolved with life on Earth, how different substances & behaviors impact sleep, how sleep changes across a human's lifetime, the costs of sleep deprivation on the brain & body, dreaming, how modern technology & norms are misaligned with our fundamental need for sleep, & much more.

#### What I Liked

Rather than regurgitating everything I took notes on while reading this book, I'll list some of my favorite tidbits:

- There are essentially two biological processes that orchestrate sleep, & they are _decoupled_: the circadian cycle, modulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the brain's hypothalamus, & the accumulation of adenosine in the brain. This dual mechanism can lead to interesting phenomena such as pulling an all-nighter (not recommended) & getting a second wind around your normal wake time because of timed hormonal releases despite adenosine buildup.

- On average, our circadian clocks are slightly longer than 24 hours, so they need to be constantly readjusted (e.g. through morning sunlight). This partially explains why it is easier to handle jet lag when traveling westward versus eastward. Eastward travel requires sleeping earlier, which in practice is harder than staying up later. Also, because of the aforementioned 24+δ clock time, it is easier to artificially stretch a day than to shrink it.

- REM & Non-REM sleep cycle throughout the night in 90-minute intervals, but the ratio of both sleep types changes as the night progresses. There's a dominance of NREM sleep earlier in the night, & vice versa for REM sleep later. NREM sleep likely "culls" new knowledge, while REM sleep integrates it into long-term memory.

- Sleep needs change dramatically during development (infancy, adolescence). Importantly though, sleep need does not seem to change in older adults, but sleep efficiency unfortunately declines. This contributes to widespread cognitive decline in older populations. Takeaway: sleep is a necessity throughout life & remains constant in adulthood, despite anecdotal experiences that may suggest otherwise.

- Dreaming happens in REM sleep. The brainwaves of wakefulness & REM sleep are strikingly similar: erratic & non-synchronous (versus slower & synchronized, ebbing brainwaves of NREM sleep). Dreams occur in REM sleep because the thalamus reopens the "sensory gates" of the brain (closed during NREM), but only to internal stimuli. Emotions, motivations, & memories play out in the visual, auditory, & kinesthetic sensory cortices of the brain. Importantly, we lose voluntary muscle control during REM sleep to prevent acting out motor commands swirling through the brain.

#### Critiques

Dr. Walker references extensive research on the "Catastrophic Cost of Sleep Deprivation" (title of Chapter 7, but research in this spirit is sprinkled throughout the book). His central argument emphasizes that prioritizing sleep improves cognitive and physical output, sometimes by many multiples compared to other exogenous compounds.

While compelling, there are detractors online challenging the veracity of many of Dr. Walker's claims. For example, [Bill Gates' review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3079578485) specifically calls out Dr. Walker's linking of insufficient sleep & Alzheimer’s development as tenuous. There are even entire takedowns of this book (["Theses on Sleep" on LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HvcZmKS43SLCbJvRb/theses-on-sleep)), with corresponding defenses (["Counter-theses on Sleep"](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sbcmACvB6DqYXYidL/counter-theses-on-sleep)).

My impression from both reading the book & skimming through critiques is that Dr. Walker appears to draw conclusions & give recommendations based on available studies that feel somewhat sensationalized, as one might expect from a book in this genre (popular science): sleep seems to be the panacea for _everything_ we humans struggle with — creativity, emotional regulation, appetite, immune responsiveness — & the loss of sleep is framed as the primary driver of many human ailments. As with most things in life, the truth likely lies somewhere in the middle, & sensationalism must be tempered with rational pragmatism. Maybe not all the conclusions in the book are fully substantiated, but I think "Theses on Sleep" (from above) in particular is even more unsubstantiated (see "Counter-theses") & comes across as an N-of-1, overly exaggerated rebuttal.

#### My Takeaways

Sleep has probably been the number one thing I've most improved on over the last couple of years. Tracking it with my Apple Watch / Garmin Watch / Whoop & getting corresponding sleep or recovery scores has been a huge motivator in this improvement. As the saying goes: "You can't improve what you can't measure." I've noticed that prioritizing sleep & adopting lifestyle changes — no alcohol consumption, eliminating caffeine consumption within 12 hours of bedtime, using blue-light blocking glasses after dusk, sleeping on a temperature controlled bed, automating & minimizing light exposure at night, etc. — have made my waking life much more pleasant & energized. I first came across Dr. Matthew Walker through his Guest Series on the Huberman Lab podcast, & later a friend recommended this book. Most of the recommendations made here weren't new to me but much of the science was, so reading this felt like a useful exercise in solidifying these healthier practices in my life.

This book was a solid 9/10. I really enjoyed it.
