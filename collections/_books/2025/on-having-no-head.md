I'm a big fan of the work being done on the [Waking Up](https://www.wakingup.com/) app. It offers a gentle, grounded, secular, & rational introduction to meditation as a practice for living an examined life, & it has been a staple in my routine for many years. Early in the Introductory Course, Sam Harris prompts us to closely examine the feeling of self, & then — little by little — he argues for its illusory nature. This concept of the illusory self expands into the closely-related realization of _having no head_.

When I first encountered this idea, it felt like an inscrutable position to maintain, especially given the seemingly paradoxical & almost-silly observations made to arrive at it, something along the lines of "as you look out into the world, notice that you don't see your head."

Harris is quick to reference _On Having No Head_ by Douglas Harding, a short book that popularized this _no-headness_ concept for Western spiritual audiences. Harding begins by describing an experience walking in the Himalayas & "[finding he] had no head...it was the revelation, at long last, of the perfectly obvious." In the next chapter, he attempts to make sense of this insight, though much of it feels like a prolonged exercise in asserting things matter-of-factly rather than sufficiently justifying them to someone not already "headless."

It is only in chapter three, Discovering Zen, that Harding strikes me as a charismatic author. Here, he humbly acknowledges the lineage of Buddhist thinkers who had already extensively described this insight — though perhaps not in terms such as "headless." The remainder of the book details Harding's steps along "the Headless Way", outlining stages such as "the Headless Infant", "the Headed Grown-up", "the Headless Seer", & so on. Again, I think he goes back to losing credibility by speaking so matter-of-factly & in a way to alienate skeptical readers.

If I were a more cynical or less interested reader, I would have put the book down after the first ten pages. But as a regular meditator who is increasingly interested in Dzogchen & other Buddhist traditions, I'm personally invested in having this headless perspective _click_ beyond an intellectual understanding. As described by the likes of Sam Harris ([Having No Head, The Illusory Self, Waking Up](https://dynamic.wakingup.com/course/CO51F8E0B)) & Richard Lang ([The Headless Way series, Waking Up](https://dynamic.wakingup.com/pack/PKBBW1C)), it seems like a worthwhile pursuit.

I think I'll revisit this book in a few years, once I've had more practice under my belt. Its brevity (~100 pages) makes an easy reread. I only wish its prose didn't lend itself so easily to being dismissed as new age mysticism with no grounding in the real world, especially because the insights feel significant for navigating life as it is.
