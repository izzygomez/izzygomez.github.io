Ocean Vuong has a voice unlike anyone else I've read. Admittedly, I don't read poetry, but I think that'll change. I enjoyed _On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous_, Vuong's debut novel, & was thus inspired to check out his earlier poetry collection, _Night Sky with Exit Wounds_.

"Reading Vuong is like watching a fish move: he manages the varied currents of English with muscled intuition" says [The New Yorker](https://web.archive.org/web/20241213180932/https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/how-a-poet-named-ocean-means-to-fix-the-english-language) — I couldn't agree more. The way he juxtaposes the mundane with the mythological (_Telemachus_, _Eurydice_), the sensual with the violent (_Aubade with Burning City_), & the personal with the communal (_Notebook Fragments_) is just incredible.

Because I mostly read in bed before going to sleep without my phone to Google things, I ended up reading poems multiple times: the first pass-through an attempt to parse the poems myself, letting the evocative language play out in my mind's eye; & later with useful [study guides](https://www.gradesaver.com/night-sky-with-exit-wounds/study-guide/summary-threshold) & interviews ([1](http://www.divedapper.com/interview/ocean-vuong/), [2](https://brooklynpoets.org/community/poet/ocean-vuong), [3](http://www.praccrit.com/poems/daily-bread/)) to help understand the themes at play. I'm glad I took this approach, because if I hadn't I wouldn't have understood the depth of some of these pieces.

For instance, in _Seventh Circle of Earth_ Vuong writes from the perspective of a gay couple that was murdered by immolation in 2011, but relegates the entire poem to a series of footnotes. On first pass, I didn't understand why & simply took it as being experimental for its own sake, but its clear (after embarrassingly having to be explained to me online) that this relegation to the footnotes parallels the relegation of queer suffering in America at large.

There are still lines in this collection that don't fully capture me, & at times it felt like Vuong was deliberately inscrutable. That could be just me not understanding things or having low endurance for reading dense prose. But overall, much like _On Earth..._, the writing here is chaotically beautiful & well worth checking out. 9/10 → 5 ⭐

Two quick side notes:

- In one of the [interviews linked above](http://www.divedapper.com/interview/ocean-vuong/), Vuong shares thoughts on the ampersand as a symbol & why he insists on using it in his writing. As an ampersand maxi, I loved this — resonated with me hard.
- There are so many great lines in this collection that could be highlighted, but I felt like the lines in _To My Father / To My Future Son_ where stars in the night sky are re-imagined as exit wounds are some of the most compelling: _...Use it to prove how the stars were always what we knew they were: the exit wounds of every misfired word._
