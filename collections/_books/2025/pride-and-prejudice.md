God, I absolutely adored _Pride and Prejudice_. I now get why it's a beloved classic.

A cursory glance at the plot might make it seem like a simple family drama: the Bennets of Longbourn, living in Regency-era Hertfordshire, face a pressing concern. With five daughters & no male heir, their estate will be entailed upon Mr. Bennet’s death, making good marriages imperative for the daughters. And admittedly the book does establish this central marriage dynamic in its opening sentence: “It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.”

But what Jane Austen created here is far more than a shallow romance novel. _Pride and Prejudice_ is a [novel of manners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel_of_manners) that artfully explores intricate social dynamics among its characters, whilst weaving a thin thread of wit & irony—both humorous and deeply critical of society. For instance, Elizabeth Bennet's intuitions & dialogue are deeply in tune with revolutionary feminist thinkers of the time, sometimes borrowing words verbatim: "Do not consider me now as an elegant female...but as a rational creature" (Vol I, Chapter 19, p. 106), where "rational creatures" directly refers to Mary Wollstonecraft's 1792 book _A Vindication of the Rights of Woman_.

What impressed me most was Austen’s treatment of her characters. Indeed it seems that Elizabeth, the central heroine of the novel, [was a favorite of hers](https://austenprose.com/2009/06/19/elizabeth-bennet-as-delightful-a-character-as-ever-appeared-in-print/). But everyone else is also distinctive: Mrs. Bennet the neurotic & melodramatic mother; Mr. Bingley the personable bachelor; Mr. Darcy the proud but principled bachelor who initially seems to lack any semblance of decorum; Mr. Collins, Longbourn's heir, is an insufferable yapper; Lady Catherine de Bourgh, the wealthy but condescending aunt of Mr. Darcy. For a novel written over two hundred years ago about a society of etiquette that no one alive today has experienced firsthand, it remains relevant because human nature has changed so little—its characters are as reflective of real people then as they are now.

The version I read had an Introduction & Notes by Vivien Jones, which I thought was indispensable to understand context that Austen may have assumed readers to have & to define words that are no longer colloquial (e.g. all the terminology related to different sorts of carriages).

Beyond the vocabulary, though, the writing style is foreign to what I usually read. Run on sentences abound, intermixing dialogue & narration, independent clauses are liberally connected via commas;— or with a punctuation mark plus an emdash, with a healthy dose of random Capitalization, & sometimes! we even get intra-sentence punctuation marks. I’m not enough of a pedant, nor knowledgeable enough about the evolution of language from then till now, for this to affect my impression. If anything, I enjoyed it more because of these idiosyncrasies.

I usually include a plot summary in my reviews, but here it doesn't feel necessary—the Wikipedia entry is [right there](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_and_Prejudice). This was so fun to read. I loved that it tied all the proverbial & nuptial knots by the end. Interestingly, even [Austen herself critiqued](https://pastnow.wordpress.com/2013/02/03/feb-4-1813-austen-it-wants-shade/) _Pride and Prejudice_ as being "...too light, and bright, and sparkling". But as John Green said in his [YouTube video on the novel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhgEpr87Yac&t=611s): "it is no sin for a book to have a happy ending." I couldn't agree more. This is an easy 10/10 for me. I'm excited to watch the movie adaptation.
