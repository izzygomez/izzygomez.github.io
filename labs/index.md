Collection of coding projects and experiments.

* [A4990 Motor Driver Shield for Arduino at Pololu](https://www.pololu.com/product/2512)
	- Designed printed circuit board for this Arduino shield using Altium Designer. Fun fact: the backside of every single board has "izzyg" etched in copper. Check the bottom of [this picture](https://www.pololu.com/picture/view/0J5720) out to see it
* [Workr: time conscious to-do list Android app that knows your calendar](https://izzygomez.com/mit/6s198/workr/)
	- Second project of my <i>Making Mobile Apps</i> class in Spring 2015. I've been testing a bunch of productivity apps (Beeminder, personal analytics through Google forms, etc), so it was fitting to design one along with my team.
* [This website](https://izzygomez.com) 
	- A continual work in progress. I've enjoyed tinkering around with this page, and am excited to see how it evolves as my interests and capacities do. For a current TODO list for future developments, check out the [TODOs section](https://github.com/izzygomez/izzygomez.github.io) in the README.md file on the Github repo page. 
* [Theta Delta Chi website](https://tdc.mit.edu)
	- Fraternity website currently being served by Wordpress. Yeah, yeah, not that technically impressive, but I'm currently working with other Brothers to build up a static website through Github pages. [Check out the repo here.](https://github.com/theta-delta-chi/theta-delta-chi.github.io)
* [Playing around with Three.js](three/)
	- Experimental page where I'm learning Three.js.
